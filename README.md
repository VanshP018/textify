🧠 Learning Journey
Textify wasn’t just about building a chat app — it was about learning how real-time applications truly work.
While building it, I explored:

The power of Socket.io for live communication

Structuring and optimizing a MERN project

Implementing secure authentication with JWT and bcryptjs

Creating responsive, minimal UIs with Daisy UI

This project taught me how each layer of a full-stack app connects — from the database to the frontend UX.
And it’s just the beginning of my development journey. 🚀

Would you like me to make a **more visually stylized version** (with emojis, shields/badges, and fancy sections for GitHub aesthetics)?  
That version would make your repository look even more polished and professional.
